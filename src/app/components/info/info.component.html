  <h1>Welcome on SimpleCRM! Feel free to try all functions.</h1>
  <p>This application is based on the idea of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. 
    All available data is for demonstration purposes only. 
    All data entered can be viewed and edited by any user. 
    Therefore, please do not enter any personal data.<br><br>
  
    The whole website is based on Angular and was realized using Firebase, 
    which serves as backend. The user interface was created using Material Design. <br><br>
    
    It is mainly used to show my experience skills in using Angular and Firebase. Have fun trying it out!
